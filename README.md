Papa's Pizzeria, an interactive 3D memory game made using HTML/CSS/JavaScript that aims to strengthen memory and coordination within Dementia patients. 
The program features 3 interactive games utilizing an optimized rendering pipeline that stitches together pre-rendered videos to simulate a real-time 3D game without the expensive rendering costs of such a program.
The game's 3D assets were modeled in Blender and interactive game mechanics were implemented by integrating 2D elements into a 3D plane.
